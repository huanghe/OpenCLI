```

> Note: `youtube comment` refuses to post unless `--execute` is passed, and never retries the write.
> **A 2xx from YouTube does not mean the comment is live** — it can answer 200 with a perfectly
> usable comment id for a comment it silently withholds (observed 2026-09-13: a video that still
> read "0 comments" afterwards). So the id the write returns is informational only; what sets
> `verified` is reading the video's comment list back and finding that id there. When the comment
> cannot be seen in the list — or no id came back at all — the row is `status: posted-unverified`
> with `verified: false` and a `COMMENT_UNVERIFIED` line on stderr, and `url` stays the plain video
> URL rather than an `&lc=` permalink that would point at a comment nobody can see. Treat that as
> "sent, go check the video", not as a failure to retry. Only a verified row gets the permalink
> (`watch?v=<id>&lc=<comment_id>`).
>
> A comment that is live but absent from the list we read would also be reported as unverified. That
> asymmetry is deliberate: an unverified success costs you one look at the video, while a false
> success makes you believe a comment landed when it did not.

## Prerequisites

- Chrome running and **logged into** youtube.com
- [Browser Bridge extension](/guide/browser-bridge) installed

## Notes

- `feed` and `search` emit `channel_avatar` (largest thumbnail the list page carries) and `video_id`; both are empty for result types that have no channel avatar or video, such as playlist lockups
- `channel` adds `channel_id` (snake_case twin of `channelId`), `subscribers_count` and `video_count` as numbers parsed from the header text (`"1.2M subscribers"` / `"2120万位订阅者"` → `21200000`); `null` when the header has no such text
- `search --type channel` rows add `channel_id`, `handle`, `subscribers` (display text), `subscribers_count`, `video_count` and `description`, so callers no longer have to reverse the handle out of `url` before calling `channel`
- `channel-videos <id|@handle|url>` follows InnerTube continuation tokens up to `--limit` (max 200)
- `video` falls back to the channel's own browse response for `channel_avatar` / `subscribers` when the watch page ships no `videoOwnerRenderer` — one extra InnerTube call, only on the pages that need it
